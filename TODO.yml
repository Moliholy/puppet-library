features:
    - Web UI:
        - asynchronous (index page loads too slowly)
    - Proxy a git repository:
        - make it work with remote forges (clone and fetch on query/download)
        - make it fast (pre-clone repos on startup (maybe just warn if they can't be found). Maybe cache artifacts?)
    - logging
    - Named subforges:
        - per-subforge queries
        - upload modules (web form and API)
        - browse proxy cache
        - clear proxy cache (web form and API)
        - delete modules from disk (web form)
    - Authentication
    - Config APIs:
        - parameterless blocks (especially for Server. Include PuppetLibrary::Forge aliased to Forge in scope)
        - validation of required params

dubious_features:
    - Proxy modules' source in a directory (supported individually for now: should we just leave it that way?)
    - Make proxy cache TTL configurable
    - Allow failover between module repositories
    - Look in /etc/puppet-library.yml for config by default

features:
    - Web UI:
        - asynchronous (index page loads too slowly)
    - Git repo forge:
        - make it more flexible:
            - support tags non-trivial names (e.g. v1.0.0)
            - fail gracefully if there's no Modulefile
    - Performance:
        - cache stuff so it's faster
        - allow configuration of cache ttl
    - logging:
        - use Ruby logging
        - include some verbose logging
        - improve error messages (e.g. for when a module can't be untarred)
    - Named subforges:
        - per-subforge queries
        - upload modules (web form and API)
        - browse proxy cache
        - clear proxy cache (web form and API)
        - delete modules from disk (web form)
    - Authentication
    - Config APIs:
        - parameterless blocks (especially for Server. Include PuppetLibrary::Forge aliased to Forge in scope)
        - validation of required params
        - documentation

dubious_features:
    - Proxy modules' source in a directory (supported individually for now: should we just leave it that way?)
    - Make proxy cache TTL configurable
    - Allow failover between module repositories
    - Look in /etc/puppet-library.yml for config by default
